# Pickle
[**Pickle**](https://pickle-gpig-app.herokuapp.com/#/) (click for live demo), a Rover clone, is an online marketplace where users can buy and sell guinea pig services, such as boarding and grooming. After signing up, users can edit their profile information, which includes account information, profile photo, service prices, and add or remove their guinea pigs. Users can also look through all members and book services.
